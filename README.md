## Documentation

I've setup `react-styleguidist` see: [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org)  
For tutorials see: [Document Your React Applications The Right Way](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/document-your-react-applications-the-right-way-f648053c3a70)  

Also would like to use the [jsDocs](https://jsdoc.app) style for documenting all other code  
See following tutorials:
